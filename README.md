# Friendship Ended Generator

A Next.js port of the PHP-based "Friendship Ended" meme generator inspired by the Asif and Mudasir friendship saga.
Fully in debt to the [work done here](https://github.com/lmaucoin/friendship-ended).

## Roadmap

- Fix the text formatting to be easier to read
- Replicate the X's to be more hand drawn
- End enough friendships to justify the hour I spent recompiling the previous repo to make this.

## Features

- Upload photos of your new friend and old friend
- Generate a classic "Friendship Ended" meme
- Works entirely in the browser - no server dependencies
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- Canvas API for image processing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
